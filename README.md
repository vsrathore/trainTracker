# Welcome to Train Tracker !

Hi! This was a fun project, which eventually i am using on weekly basis. It is very handly **utility to track IndianRailway train ticket.**  


## Usage/Parameters
*I use this utility to track train tickets because i am frequent travel between DELHI-JAIPUR* It will not work during Tatkal Booking Hours, due to some IRCTC restrictions.
Best use is after chart prepared, on light passenger load trains/routes. *This workes best for JP-DELHI route (for me)*.
